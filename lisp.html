                <h2>General History</h2>
                <p>Lisp is a <strong>functional programming language</strong> designed for easy manipulation of data strings. 
                    It's the second-oldest high-level programming language in the world. 
                    It was invented by John McCarthy in 1958 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
                    Lisp stands for <em>list processing</em> and was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs. 
                    Today, Lisp is popular in artificial intelligence research. Lisp introduced tree data structures, 
                    automatic storage management, dynamic typing, and self-hosting compilers which are now widely used ideas in computer science.
