                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>PHP, which used to stand for Personal Home Page was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf, 
                    a Danish-Canadian programmer. It was released to the public in 1995 and used in more that one million websites around the world. 
                    PHP is an open-source server-side <strong>scripting language</strong> that is used in web development. 
                    It's acronym now stands for <em>Hypertext preprocessor</em>. 
                    PHP is used in lots of major sites like Facebook and Wikipedia and surveys state that it's used in about 78% of websites on the web. 
                    Server-side scripting means that a server executes the instructions in a script and outputs the results in a HTML format. 
                    Those scripts can be used to customise the website, make dynamic changes to its content, access databases and access servers.
