                <h2>General History</h2>
                <p>Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, a Japanese computer programmer, invented Ruby in the mid-1990s. 
                    It was publicly released in 1995 but started being widely used in 2006, after its web development framework “Ruby on Rails” was released. 
                    It's an open-source object-oriented <strong>scripting language</strong>, which means it doesn't directly talk to the hardware. 
                    The general-purpose language can be used for web development, static site generation, automation, and web servers. 
                    Ruby has been used in Hulu, MyFitness Pal and Airbnb, while the Ruby on Rails framework is used in sites like Shoptify, Twitch and GitHub, 
                    which shows the versatility of the language.
